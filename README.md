# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

I'd like to complete work on an idea for a software developer automated bounties system similar to Gitcoin.

I've begun work here https://github.com/openqdev with the incomplete marketing website here openq.dev

Right now the contracts in the bare-bones-refactor branch of the /contracts repo has the basics: UserAddressStorage, DepositStorage, etc.

Much remains to be done for the final project though - in particular, implementing a Hash Time Locked Contract for the escrow and possibly using Airnode as an oracle.
